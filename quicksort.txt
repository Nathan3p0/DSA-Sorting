2. Understanding quicksort

1) Suppose you are debugging a quicksort implementation that is supposed to sort an array in ascending order. After the first partition step has been completed, the contents of the array is in the following order: 3 9 1 14 17 24 22 20. Which of the following statements is correct about the partition step? Explain your answer.


The pivot could have been either 14 or 17

Either one could be the pivot, because they are both already sorted in the correct order.

2) Given the following list of numbers 14, 17, 13, 15, 19, 10, 3, 16, 9, 12 show the resulting list after the second partitioning according to the quicksort algorithm.

When using the last item on the list as a pivot
[3, 9, 10, 12, 19, 14, 17, 16, 13, 15]
